# Career Topologies

**Career Topologies** is a strategic framework designed to create fair, transparent, and sustainable career paths inside technology organizations.  
It provides a structured way to define roles, expectations, growth paths, and evaluation criteria across engineering, product, data, design, and related areas.

The model helps companies avoid ad-hoc promotions, unclear ladders, and subjective performance evaluations by offering a consistent, principle-driven system.

## About the Creator

Career Topologies was created by **Guilherme “Gui” Santos**, a Brazilian Platform Engineering and Developer Experience leader.

He has:
- Led and supported **tech teams and communities** focused on Platform Engineering, SRE and DevEx.  
- Built and maintained **career frameworks, ladders and leveling systems** in technology organizations.  
- Organized **Platform Rocks**, an ecosystem of education, community and tools for platform engineering professionals.

The framework is a consolidation of:
- Practical experience designing ladders in real companies  
- Community feedback from engineers, managers and HR  
- The need to balance **fairness, clarity and flexibility** in fast-changing tech environments

## Core Components

### 1. Leveling
A clear hierarchy of levels (e.g., L1 → L7) that defines:
- Scope of impact  
- Ownership expectations  
- Autonomy  
- Technical depth  
- Leadership maturity  

Levels apply consistently across roles to prevent compensation and title fragmentation.

### 2. Progression Pillars
The framework organizes skills into pillars, such as:
- **Technical Excellence**  
- **Execution & Delivery**  
- **Communication & Collaboration**  
- **Leadership & Influence**  
- **Strategy & Vision**  

Each pillar has detailed descriptions per level to guide evaluations and promotions.

### 3. Ladder Principles
A set of principles that guide how career paths should be built. Examples:
- Merit over seniority  
- Consistency across teams  
- Clear expectations per level  
- Equal opportunities for ICs and Managers  

These principles ensure fairness and stability across the organization.

### 4. Guidelines for Implementation
Practical guidance for rolling out the framework:
- How to align HR, managers, compensation, and recruiting  
- How to avoid legal and naming inconsistencies  
- How to train managers and teams  
- How to maintain and improve the ladder over time

## Career Models Supported

Career Topologies supports multiple “topologies” based on how organizations structure growth paths:

### **Y-Shaped Model**
A split between:
- **Management Track**
- **Individual Contributor (IC) Track**

### **W-Shaped Model**
Adds a third hybrid route:
- Staff-plus direction (technical + strategic)  
or  
- Tech-lead coach / consulting-oriented path

### **Network / Mesh Model**
A fluid approach that allows transitions across areas and tracks, ideal for modern, multi-disciplinary teams.

## Talent Shapes

The framework also uses professional “shapes” to describe skill profiles:
- **I-Shaped**: Deep specialist  
- **T-Shaped**: Specialist with broad adjacent knowledge  
- **Pi-Shaped / Comb-Shaped**: Multi-disciplinary specialist  

These shapes help organizations understand and plan team capabilities.

## Manifesto (Pillars)

Career Topologies is grounded in eight values:
1. Transparency  
2. Merit  
3. Equality  
4. Consistency  
5. Cooperation  
6. Diversity  
7. Ownership  
8. Flexibility  

These principles anchor the framework in fairness and long-term organizational health.
